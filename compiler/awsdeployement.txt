ec2 instance provide us a powerful linux system which you can use to do your shell scripting and giving instructions, installing dependencies etc
s3 bucket is to store static data like images, codes or any static file

we use aws for the following reasons:
security
scalability -> eg leetcode scales itself on saturday afternoon to sunday afernoon to accomodate the two contests it takes, and again descales as and when not required
cost efficiency -> you pay for only what you use

Learnt about ECS, ECR and EC2
